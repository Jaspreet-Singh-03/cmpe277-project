# Cmpe277 Project - Food Sharing App
CMPE 277 Final Project ( An Android Application called as Food Sharing App)

- The current version requires a local backend server ( Although the application can be configured to be run on a cloud based environment, but would require hosting the central mongo db and backend tomcat server on the cloud)
- To Run the application, clone the repo to the directory
- Run the application in the emulator
- Simuntaneously, run the backend tomcat server in the backend folder ( use IDE like eclipse to easily run the server)
- Either change the backend server application.properties file to point to the mongodb databse, or use tools like docker to run the mongo db locally. Steps to do that are contained in the reoot file name "Docker"
- Once the setup is complete, you can easily run the application
